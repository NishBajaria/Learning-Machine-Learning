# Learning-Machine-Learning
A documentation of my route in learning ML from scratch.

Below is a list of the resources that I have used or referred to:

* [How to Learn Machine Learning](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning)

Firstly, I completed Andrew NG's indepth [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on coursera. Whilst outdated, it covers the fundamentals very well. The assignments I completed as part of the course can be found [linked](https://github.com/NishBajaria/Learning---Machine-Learning). 

I will now start working on different projects, to further solidy what I have learnt from the course. 

As part of this process, I will also need to be able to implement the following algorithms from scratch on more simple datasets to also gain a better understanding of how particular algorithms work. In the interest of saving time, I will in most cases be randomly generating datasets to use.

* Linear Regression 
* Logistic regression
* Descision tree
* SVM (support vector machine)
* Naive Bayes
* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
* K-Means
* Random Forest
* Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
* Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost By implementing them at the most basic level, I will be able to gain a greater appreciation for their stengths and limitations.
